You are building a personal portfolio website to showcase projects. 
Create a new web project using a modern static framework (e.g. Angular.js) with Tailwind CSS for styling. 
The site should use a dark color scheme and a responsive CSS grid on the homepage to display project cards. 
Each card must link to the corresponding project URL (these projects will be on subdomains of the hub). 
Add smooth hover animations to the cards for interactivity. Include a “Contact” page with a form that integrates with a service like Formspree or Netlify Forms. 
Implement one standout interactive feature (e.g. a soothing animation or unique scrolling) to make the design unique. 
Set up an admin interface using Netlify CMS (add an `/admin` folder with `index.html` and config) so the project list can be edited via a web UI. 
Ensure the design remains minimalist and dark-themed throughout. Finally, configure the project for free static hosting (Netlify/Vercel/Static.run) and mention how to use Git for deployment.
